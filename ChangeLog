THis file contains the version history for NFFT 3.x.x. 

Changes in version 3.1.2:
  - Fixed a bug in fpt_precompute() that caused excessive stabilization and 
    incorrect results.
  - Added experimental code that leverages support for libdispatch. This allows 
    code to be executed in parallel on platforms that support the library. As of
    now, this only affects ndft_trafo().

Changes in version 3.1.1:
  - Added a workaround for an internal compiler error occuring with gcc 4.3.2.

Changes in version 3.1.0:
  - The FPT example program, that is, examples/fpt/simple_test has been 
    modified to not require the NFCT module anymore. This solves the problem 
    that NFFT won't compile when the FPT module has been switched on while the 
    NFCT module is swithced off.

Changes in version 3.1.0:
  - A module, called nfsoft, for fast Fourier transforms on the rotation group 
    SO(3) has been added.
  - It is now possible to configure the build process so that only specific
    modules are compiled and installed. Invoke the configure script with option
    "--help" for details.
  - The handling of how to link against the fftw3 library has been improved. The
    new configure script options "--with-fftw3", "--with-fftw-includedir", and
    "--with-fftw-libdir" allow to specify where fftw3 has been installed.
  - Improved compliance with GNU standards.
  - The experimental Matlab interface has been improved and is now officially a
    part of NFFT3. To compile the Matlab modules, invoke the configure script
    with the option --with-matlab=<path/to/matlab/directory>. Also, an interface
    to the plain NFFT has been added.

Changes in version 3.0.2:
  - Fixed a bug in the fpt module that lead to wrong output.
