    - #18 Define format string for ptrdiff_t in platform-dependent macro.

    Enhancements
    - #3 Allow to select scope of unit tests via configure.
    - #1 Extend Travis CI configuration.

Changes in version 3.3.0:
  - Added unit tests for some parts of the library. They are invoked via make
    check, but only if the CUnit framework was found on the build host.

Changes in version 3.2.4
  - Fixed an issue when linker flags were not set correctly.

Changes in version 3.2.3
  - Added a workaround for an internal compiler error occuring with gcc 4.7.1
    in kernel/mri
  - Added a workaround for a compilation error in the MATLAB mex interface for
    gcc 4.7.1 when compiling with C99 support (-std=gnu99)

Changes in version 3.2.2:
  - Fixed several problems introduced in version 3.2.1
  - Fixed an issue when the configure script would not run correctly when using
    the option --with-fftw3.

Changes in version 3.2.1:
  - Added missing files of new nfft MATLAB (class) interface to release.

Changes in version 3.2.0:
  - Added support for OpenMP. To activate, use the configure script with the
    --enable-openmp option.
  - Added ticks.h from FFTW to leverage CPU cycle counters. If cycle counters
    are available, the configure script will try to determine the number of
    ticks per second. If successful, example programs measure times in seconds.
    Otherwise, example programs will output raw cycle counter differences in
    arbitrary units. If cycle counters are not available, results of time
    measurements are undefined.
  - Renamed functions of direct (non-fast) algorithms to
    <function name of fast algorithm>_direct, e.g. the function name for the
    direct computation of the non-equispaced Fourier transform is
    nfft_trafo_direct(nfft_plan) instead of ndft_trafo(nfft_plan).

Changes in version 3.1.4:
  - Added pkg-config file (thanks Gert Wollny)
  - Headers include/nfft3util.h, applications/fastsum/fastsum.h, and
    applications/fastsum/kernels.h can now be included by C++ compilers.
  - Fixed an error that occured when trying to create symbolic links to Matlab mex
    files during installation.
  - All programs from the application and examples subdirectories are no longer
    installed. The same holds for the Matlab code from the matlab subdirectory.

Changes in version 3.1.3:
  - Fixed some issues that can cause C++ compilers to fail. Thanks to Romain Bossart.
  - Fixed an error that caused linking against FFTW while checking compiler
    characteristics in the configure script. This only affected installations where
    FFTW had been installed in a custom location.
  - Doxygen generated documentation is now only deleted if the target
    maintainer-clean is used. The documentation is no longer deleted if the user
    invokes the usual clean target.

Changes in version 3.1.2:
  - Fixed a bug in fpt_precompute() that caused excessive stabilization and
    incorrect results.
  - Fixed three bugs in the nfft: window function defines are moved to the
    internal header infft.h, a larger lookup table is used for PRE_LIN_PSI, and
    nfft_adjoint for d=2,3 and PRE_FULL_PSI writes its output correctly.

Changes in version 3.1.1:
  - Added a workaround for an internal compiler error occuring with gcc 4.3.2.

Changes in version 3.1.0:
  - The FPT example program, that is, examples/fpt/simple_test has been
    modified to not require the NFCT module anymore. This solves the problem
    that NFFT won't compile when the FPT module has been switched on while the
    NFCT module is swithced off.

Changes in version 3.1.0:
  - A module, called nfsoft, for fast Fourier transforms on the rotation group
    SO(3) has been added.
  - It is now possible to configure the build process so that only specific
    modules are compiled and installed. Invoke the configure script with option
    "--help" for details.
  - The handling of how to link against the fftw3 library has been improved. The
    new configure script options "--with-fftw3", "--with-fftw-includedir", and
    "--with-fftw-libdir" allow to specify where fftw3 has been installed.
  - Improved compliance with GNU standards.
  - The experimental Matlab interface has been improved and is now officially a
    part of NFFT3. To compile the Matlab modules, invoke the configure script
    with the option --with-matlab=<path/to/matlab/directory>. Also, an interface
    to the plain NFFT has been added.

Changes in version 3.0.2:
  - Fixed a bug in the fpt module that lead to wrong output.
