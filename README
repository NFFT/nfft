NFFT3 - Nonequispaced FFT, generalisations, inversion, and applications

Overview
--------
NFFT3 is a software library written in C for computing nonequispaced fast Fourier  
and related transformations. In detail, NFFT3 implements

 1) The nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
    - the forward transform (NFFT)
    - the adjoint transform (adjoint NFFT)
 2) Generalisations of the NFFT
    - to arbitrary knots in time and frequency domain (NNFFT)
    - to the sphere S^2 (NFSFT)
    - to the hyperbolic cross (NSFFT)
    - to real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, (NFCT, NFST)
 3) Generalised inverses based on iterative methods, e.g. CGNR, CGNE 
 4) Applications in
    - medical imaging
         (i) magnetic resonance imaging
        (ii) computerised tomography
    - summation schemes
          (i) fast Gauss transform (FGT)
         (ii) singular kernels
        (iii) zonal kernels
    - polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform

For an introduction, please read the "NFFT 3.0 - Tutorial" first. It is 
available in the subdirectory doc/tutorial/tutorial.pdf. Detailed API 
documentation can be found in HTML format in /doc/api/html/index.html
or in LaTeX format for self compilation in /doc/api/latex/refman.tex.
For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.
