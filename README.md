NFFT - Nonequispaced FFT
=========================

Overview
--------
NFFT is a software library, written in C, for computing non-equispaced fast
Fourier transforms and related variations. It implements the following
transforms:

1. Non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
    - forward transform *(NFFT)*, i.e. frequency to time/space domain
    - adjoint transform *(adjoint NFFT)*, i.e. time/space to frequency domain

2. Generalisations
    - to arbitrary nodes in time *and* frequency domain *(NNFFT)*
    - to real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, *(NFCT, NFST)*
    - to the sphere S^2 *(NFSFT)*
    - to the rotation group *(NFSOFT)*
    - to the hyperbolic cross *(NSFFT)*

3. Generalised inverse transformations based on iterative methods, e.g. CGNR/CGNE

Some examples for application of these transforms are provided:

1. Medical imaging
    - magnetic resonance imaging (mri)
    - computerised tomography (radon)

2. Summation schemes
    - fast summation (fastsum)
    - fast Gauss transform (FGT)
    - singular kernels
    - zonal kernels

3. polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform

Detailed API documentation in HTML format can be found in
`doc/html/index.html`, if you are working from a release tarball.
When working from a source repository, the documentation can be
generated with Doxygen.
```
make doc
```

Building
--------
The NFFT depends on the [FFTW](https://fftw.org) library, which is available for many Linux distros, Homebrew on macOS and MSYS2 on Windows. If you compile the FFTW yourself, it should be configured `--enable-shared`.

When working from a source repository, you need to run libtoolize and autoreconf first. A bash script to do this is provided.
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

The rest of the build process is standard.
```
./configure --enable-all --enable-openmp [add options as necessary, see below]
```

Alternatively, you might run the configure script for Matlab.
```
./configure --enable-all --enable-openmp --with-matlab=/path/to/matlab
```

Here are some useful optional flags for `./configure`:
* `--enable-all` specifies that all modules should be compiled,
* `--enable-openmp` enables the multicore support and
* `--enable-julia` specifies that the julia interface will be compiled.
* `--with-matlab=path/to/matlab` specifies a path of Matlab, and
* `--with-octave=path/to/octave` does the same for GNU Octave.
* For a list of all available options, run `./configure --help`.

Build the software.
```
make
```

Optionally, unit tests may be run.
```
make check
```

Optionally, install NFFT on your system.
```
make install
```
